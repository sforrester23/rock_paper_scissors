# Rock, Paper, Scissors python game!! :newspaper: :scissors: :exclamation:

This is a git repo containing a python based Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer. Will you dare to take it on?

It works using a random number generator between numbers 1 and 3 inclusive for the computers choice of the three options. Each of these represents either Rock, Paper or Scissors. 

The user is then asked to make their choice between Rock, Paper and Scissors, then assigns this choice to the corresponding value of 1, 2, 3 and compares this to the computers (random) choice.

It then lets you know the results! :game_die: 

### :rocket: Will you dare play? :trophy:
